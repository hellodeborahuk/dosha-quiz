# Creating a Dosha Quiz

First up I created a design for the dosha quiz in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/ZunMd3aIgTKHU4vtnyq3j8/Dosha-Quiz?node-id=0%3A1 and found a colour scheme I liked the look of: https://coolors.co/d65ba6-c36fdc-383d6e-4b5395-6ccff6

I wanted a quiz where when you select an option, it would automatically move you forward to the next question. 

# To figure out

- back button goes to previous page
- Question number needs to increase on page increase
- onClick of answer it moves on to next page
- On question 11, onClick goes to results page
- results page works out percentage for dosha result
- results 'find out more' button goes to 1 of 6 pages with information about that dosha, duel dosha, tri dosha
