          Kapha is based on earth and water. It can be described as steady,
          stable, heavy, slow, cold, and soft. Spring is known as kapha season,
          as many parts of the world slowly exit hibernation.

        <h2> How to balance your kapha</h2>
        <p>
          Since Kapha is inherently cold, heavy, and dense, the key to balancing
          Kapha is stimulation. Kaphas tend to cling to the status quo and
          routine, so they need the stimulation of new sights, sounds, and
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kaphas are particularly sensitive to cold, damp conditions and benefit
          from heat. Use dry heat if you are congested—a common Kapha complaint.
          Using a heating pad under your back or a sunlamp at your chest is
          often helpful. Avoid exposing your nose, throat, and lungs to cold
          winter air if you aren’t feeling well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get regular exercise. This is the best way to avoid stagnation and the
          accumulation of toxins in the body. Focus on building endurance. Favor
          running, bicycling, swimming, aerobics, and competitive sports. You
          can also dance to energizing rhythmic music.
