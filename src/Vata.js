          Vata’s elemental makeup consists of air and ether. The common
          translation of vata is “that which moves things.” Vata is often
          referred to as the wind in the body, and it is the primary motivating
          force of the doshas—without it, the other doshas are unable to move.

        <h2> How to balance your vata</h2>
        <p>
          If excessive stress in your life leads to your Vata force becoming
          imbalanced, your activity will start to feel out of control. Your mind
          may race, contributing to anxiety and insomnia. You may start skipping
          meals, resulting in unintended weight loss, and your digestion may
          become irregular. If you notice these early symptoms of a Vata
          imbalance, slow down, take time to meditate, don’t skip meals, and get
          to bed earlier. A regular lifestyle routine helps ground Vata so
          you’re not carried away into the ethers. Vata is cold, light,
          irregular, dry, and always changing. To balance Vata, make choices
          that bring warmth, stability, and consistency to your life. Try to get
          to bed before 10 p.m., wake up by 6 a.m., and eat your meals at
          regular times.
